#Query: go forward (a bit)
#this is a single action. So in the list, there is only one list. Because 1 represent go forward,so the first number in the list is 1.And the distance is unknown, so we use 1 as the default number in the list.

#Query: move forward while facing a point (3, 4)
#this is a single action. So in the list, there is only one list. Because 1 represent go forward, so the first number in the list is 1, the second number in the list is 'FF', the point is (3, 4), so the third and forth number is 3 and 4.

#Query: go to point (3, 4)
#this is a single action. So in the list, there is only one list. Because 3 represent go to a given point, so the first number in the list is 4, no name of point is mentioned, the second element is 'FF', the point is (3, 4), so the third fourth number is 3 and 4. No facing is needed, thus the rest of the list is 'FF'.

#Query: rotate around point (4.2, 4.5) with radius 2.6 
#this is a single action. So in the list, there is only one list. Because 4 represent rotate around a given point or object, so the first number in the list is 4, and no name of location/object, the second element is 'FF', the point is (4.2, 4.5), so the third and fourth number is 4.2 and 4.5, the radius is 2.6, so the fifth number is 2.6, the number of circles is 1, so the sixth number is 1. No facing is needed, thus the seventh number is 0, and the rest of the list is 'FF'.
