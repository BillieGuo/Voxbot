# Folder for LLM 

Put the LLM you want to use here for your program.

LLM will be setup if the correct path/name is provided in "config.yaml".

__Note__: Better to create and named the folder exactly the same as the correspongding name of LLM you want to use. The program will automatically generate the path to the name of folder you assign in "config.yaml".
